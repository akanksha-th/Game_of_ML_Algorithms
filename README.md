## Game of ML Algorithms

#### Welcome to Game of ML Algorithms!

This repository documents a structured approach to exploring different aspects of a data science project. Over time, I will cover various concepts and techniques, working through them each day. The focus will be on:

    Data Science Fundamentals: Understanding key concepts and methodologies.
    ML Algorithms: Applying and building algorithms to solve real-world problems.
    Project Execution: Applying learned techniques to complete a comprehensive project.

#### What to Expect

    Daily Exploration: Each day focuses on a specific data science concept or technique.
    Hands-On Practice: Implementation of machine learning algorithms and building them from scratch.
    Problem Solving: Applying learned skills to solve practical problems and build complete solutions.

Feel free to explore the different sections, contribute, or follow along as I progress through this learning journey.
